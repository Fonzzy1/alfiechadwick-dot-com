      <description>In my last post I ended by planting my flag and making my predictions for the Hottest 100 for 2023. And on first glance, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with myself, picking not only the top song, but a good chunk of the top 20. So today I just want to do a quick follow up on how I did.
Top 20  Song Artist Predicted 1 paint the town red doja cat 1 2 the worst person alive g flip 55 3 saving up dom dolla NA 4 rhyme dust mk 72 5 prada cass 90 6 adore u fred again 40 7 what was i made for?</description>

      <description>Like many Australians, I spent my last Saturday in January getting hyped for the Triple J Hottest 100 countdown. And for the past few years, there has been a project run by 100 Warm Tunas that has been remarkably accurate at predicting the results of the countdown.
Warm Tunas makes predictions by scraping social media posts for people&amp;rsquo;s votes and then collating them as a sample of all votes. While this method is highly effective, I feel that it misses the point a bit when it comes to understanding why a song is popular.</description>
