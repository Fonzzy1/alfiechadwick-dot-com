      <description>Like many Australians, I spent my last Saturday in January getting hyped for the Triple J Hottest 100 countdown. And for the past few years, there has been a project run by 100 Warm Tunas that has been remarkably accurate at predicting the results of the countdown.&#xA;Warm Tunas makes predictions by scraping social media posts for peopleâ€™s votes and then collating them as a sample of all votes. While this method is highly effective, I feel that it misses the point a bit when it comes to understanding why a song is popular.</description>

      <description>This site is built through blogdown, which is a marvellous little R package that integrates Hugo sites into a R workflow. A nice thing about Hugo sites are the large number of themes available to quickly integrate with your site to change the vibe. My theme is mostly just a recolored version of the hello-friend-ng theme, using catppuccin for the colors.&#xA;My only gripe with the theme is that it uses a default list for all types of content.</description>
