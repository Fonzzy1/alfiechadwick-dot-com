      <description>Eulerâ€™s Method How to expand the Euler method? Taylor Series How to make the approximation fit the ODE The Final Algorithm If you ever start doing university level maths, physics, chemistry or even economics, you will most likely start running into differential equations. These are equations that describe functions in terms of their derivatives. Normally in these classes, at least at the start, all the problems are solvable by hand with some fairly rudimentary algebra and calculus.</description>

      <description>This is a place that I use to show off the projects that I work on. There&amp;rsquo;s going to be a lot of weird thing&amp;rsquo;s that come out of problems that I come up with in my every day life, and the solutions are fun optimisation issues that are sometimes pretty cool.&#xA;If you ever want to talk to me my email is alfiechadwick@hotmail.com or shoot me a message on linkedin.</description>
