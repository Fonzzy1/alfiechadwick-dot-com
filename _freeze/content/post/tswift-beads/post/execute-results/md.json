An important part of that preparation is making friendship bracelets to trade at the concert. So we headed down to Spotlight and grabbed ourselves a couple of bags of beads to make the bracelets. However, when we opened them up, we found that the distribution of letters was all over the place. We had a heap of useless Zs while also having almost no vowels. Instead of driving back to Spotlight, I decided to see if I could make enough friendship bracelets from the letters we already had, while also being a bit clever about which songs we were going to make friendship bracelets for.\n\n![The beads after I spent 15 minutes organinsing them](/post/tswift-beads/pic.jpg)\n\n## First Try\n\nI set out to make an algorithm to determine the best set of song titles we could use. I want to assign each song title a cost, and then make the song with the lowest cost the bracelets. I can keep doing this until I can't make any more bracelets. To determine the cost of a song title, I just summed the costs of its letters. The cost of the letters was the number of occurrences it had in the list of songs divided by the number of beads I had remaining for that letter.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport re\n\ndef count_chars_in_list(list_of_strings):\n    char_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    for string in list_of_strings:\n        for char in string:\n            char_counts[char] += 1\n    \n    return dict(char_counts)\n\n\ndef bracelets(song_list, bead_dict):\n\n    # W and M is interchangeable\n    cleaned_dict = {\n        re.sub(r'\\W+', '', i.lower()).replace(\"w\",\"m\"): i \n        for i in song_list\n    }\n\n    # dict of letter usage totals\n    letter_popularity = count_chars_in_list(cleaned_dict.keys())\n\n    # will run until a break is called\n    while True:\n        cost_dict = {}\n        # Determine the cost of all the songs\n        for song in cleaned_dict.keys():\n            song_cost = 0\n            flag = False\n            for char in song: \n                # Assign the cost by adding up beads value\n                if char in bead_dict:\n                    # If no beads for that letter are left then that word cant be formed\n                    if bead_dict[char] == 0:\n                        flag = True\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        song_cost += letter_popularity[char]/bead_dict[char]\n            if not flag:\n                cost_dict[song] = song_cost\n\n        # Finish loop if no more songs can be made\n        if len(cost_dict) ==0:\n            break\n        # Find the cheapest song\n        cost_dict_sorted = list(dict(sorted(cost_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])).keys())\n        cheapeast_song = cost_dict_sorted[0]\n        print(cleaned_dict[cheapeast_song])\n        # Remove the cheapest songs beads from the bead counts\n        for char in cheapeast_song:\n            bead_dict[char] -= 1\nbracelets(song_list.copy(), bead_dict.copy())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nivy\nivy\nivy\nivy\nivy\nivy\nivy\nivy\nivy\nRun\nSlut\nME\nSlut\nivy\nME\nRun\nhoax\nSlut\nME\nhoax\nGlitch\nRun\nivy\nME\nhoax\nGlitch\nhoax\nME\nGlitch\nKarma\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis was pretty good, but let's remove the repeated songs because I don't want to have 10 bracelets with Ivy on them.
