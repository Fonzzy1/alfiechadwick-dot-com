And on first glance, I'm pretty happy with myself, picking not only the top song, but a good chunk of the top 20. So today I just want to do a quick follow up on how I did.\n\n# Top 20\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                     Song         Artist Predicted\n1      paint the town red       doja cat         1\n2  the worst person alive         g flip        55\n3               saving up      dom dolla        NA\n4              rhyme dust             mk        72\n5                   prada           cass        90\n6                 adore u     fred again        40\n7    what was i made for?  billie eilish         3\n8                    rush    troye sivan        10\n9             lovin on me    jack harlow        17\n10               chemical    post malone        14\n11                vampire olivia rodrigo         2\n12                 rumble       skrillex        NA\n13              kill bill            sza         9\n14             atmosphere         fisher        NA\n15                 nanana      peggy gou         5\n16               sprinter           dave         4\n17             back on 74         jungle        NA\n18           eat your man      dom dolla        NA\n19                therapy       budjerah        NA\n20          sorry instead    spacey jane        NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe top 10 seems okay, but i did miss a lot of the top 20 completely. I seemed to be undervaluing Australian artists such as Dom Dolla, Spacey Jane, and G Flip, as well as EDM as a genre, which made up a much greater portion of the top 20 than I predicted.\n\n\n# Snubbed Songs\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                      Song                Artist Predicted\n1                love type              poolclvb         6\n2                super ego          babe rainbow         8\n3                   adored            royel otis        15\n4         lost without you             san cisco        21\n5             super-vision                  dice        22\n6             blak britney          miss kaninna        24\n7                 ruthless         hooligan hefs        26\n8                attention              doja cat        27\n9               james dean          tash sultana        28\n10             do it again                 benee        33\n11        i wish you roses            kali uchis        35\n12           dash of speed            rum jungle        36\n13                too much         the kid laroi        37\n14              eyes ahead                  dice        38\n15          pets and drugs            the rubens        42\n16          into your room     holly humberstone        44\n17                      up                   lee        46\n18                 pegasus            arlo parks        47\n19               exploding         angie mcmahon        48\n20                 calling          metro boomin        50\n21            must be nice                  ruel        51\n22             better love            eliza rose        52\n23            your funeral                  maya        53\n24       don't let me down         gus dapperton        54\n25               conceited            lola young        56\n26               messed up             holy holy        57\n27        lost in the rush              telenova        58\n28            candle flame                jungle        59\n29            prescription             remi wolf        63\n30                  change                laurel        64\n31                   angel        pinkpantheress        65\n32                  sinner the last dinner party        66\n33                 midwest             vacations        67\n34             pretty girl             ice spice        68\n35           i wanna dance            royel otis        71\n36       make up your mind                cordae        74\n37              viper room             thornhill        75\n38              weightless            arlo parks        76\n39       can't play myself                skepta        78\n40          black mascara.                  raye        79\n41              feel alive                   cat        80\n42                tied up!         genesis owusu        81\n43          mrs. hollywood                  gojo        84\n44           am i dreaming          metro boomin        85\n45                 comma's               onefour        86\n46                    lola                  maya        87\n47 it's cool to be in love         greta stanley        88\n48    since i have a lover                 6lack        89\n49           lil boo thang          paul russell        91\n50            going kokomo            royel otis        93\n51             all my life              lil durk        94\n52            brain freeze northeast party house        95\n53                 healing      molly millington        96\n54                  sticky                  kito        97\n55                  rakata     the jungle giants        98\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSo there were 55 songs in my predictions that didn't make it into the countdown, including 3 of my top 20. Funily enough though, a lot of my predictions seemed to line up with peoples opions online with [Love Type](https://www.reddit.com/r/triplej/comments/1adh146/comment/kk1b24c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [Super Ego](https://www.reddit.com/r/triplej/comments/1adh146/comment/kk16o08/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [Adored](https://www.reddit.com/r/triplej/comments/1adh146/comment/kk1hqcl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) all being mentioned as snubs from the hottest 100.\n\n\n# Surprise Songs\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                   Song               Artist rank\n1             saving up            dom dolla    3\n2                rumble             skrillex   12\n3            atmosphere               fisher   14\n4            back on 74               jungle   17\n5          eat your man            dom dolla   18\n6               therapy             budjerah   19\n7         sorry instead          spacey jane   20\n8           be your man               g flip   22\n9           take it off               fisher   23\n10      rich baby daddy                drake   25\n11                rough               g flip   26\n12      dance the night             dua lipa   28\n13    say yes to heaven         lana del rey   29\n14    not strong enough            boygenius   30\n15        get him back!       olivia rodrigo   34\n16         baby again..           fred again   35\n17   boy's a liar pt. 2       pinkpantheress   36\n18             laced up        hilltop hoods   37\n19         scary movies            the rions   40\n20             pedestal        lime cordiale   42\n21              popular           the weeknd   43\n22           sweetheart            old mervs   47\n23          padam padam        kylie minogue   48\n24            australia               g flip   50\n25                  ten           fred again   51\n26     i used to be fun           teen jesus   52\n27          lookin' out        king stingray   53\n28   more than you know             blink182   54\n29   all-american bitch       olivia rodrigo   56\n30             darkside bring me the horizon   57\n31                 lost bring me the horizon   58\n32                  a&w         lana del rey   60\n33    fall at your feet           peking duk   64\n34            real life               g flip   65\n35    leaving the light        genesis owusu   69\n36               snooze                  sza   70\n37           speedracer         teenage dads   74\n38       nobody gets me                  sza   75\n39            sofa king           royel otis   76\n40 i don't wanna be ...                 ruel   77\n41                bleed        the kid laroi   78\n42 video killed the ...         teenage dads   79\n43               7 days               g flip   80\n44     like a girl does            peach prc   81\n45                 exes           tate mcrae   82\n46        the summoning          sleep token   83\n47     midnight driving         teenage dads   88\n48            nightmare              polaris   90\n49 did you know that...         lana del rey   91\n50  strawberry daydream       pacific avenue   92\n51          no bad days           the terrys   93\n52   welcome to the dcc  nothing but thieves   95\n53         stay blessed        genesis owusu   97\n54        cool about it            boygenius   98\n55           i miss you        slowly slowly   99\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWith 55 snubs, we are going to have 55 surprise songs. There doesn't seem to be  a massive trend here. G flip only made it into my countdown twice, so 5 of their songs are in this list. Its also interesting seeing which conventionally popular songs are part of this list.  Boy's a liar pt. 2  by Pinkpantheress and All American-Bitch which peaked at 2 and 10 on the aria charts were left out in my predictions, even though it predicted similar chart toppers in the top 10.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](post-2.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/suroprise-comps-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLooking at these plots, it seems that the chart data for these songs didn't correctly join with the play data from triple J. After cleaning the names, I was hoping that there wouldn't be too much of a discrepancy. However, in the ARIA charts, \"all-american bitch\" is listed as \"all-american b\\*\\*ch,\" and \"boys a liar pt. 2\" is listed as \"boys a liar\". This kind of discrepancy is probably present throughout my dataset and may have led to some major inaccuracies. However, it is also just part of life when dealing with text data.\n\n# Did I do better than Warm Tuna?\n\nPart of my mission when setting out to make these predictions was to outperform 100 Warm Tunas, who utilize a compilation of social media posts to formulate their predictions.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                     Song         Artist rank warm_tuna my_rankning\n1      paint the town red       doja cat    1         9           1\n2  the worst person alive         g flip    2        11          55\n3               saving up      dom dolla    3        18          NA\n4              rhyme dust             mk    4         5          72\n5                   prada           cass    5        19          90\n6                 adore u     fred again    6         6          40\n7    what was i made for?  billie eilish    7         4           3\n8                    rush    troye sivan    8         1          10\n9             lovin on me    jack harlow    9        49          17\n10               chemical    post malone   10        28          14\n11                vampire olivia rodrigo   11        14           2\n12                 rumble       skrillex   12         3          NA\n13              kill bill            sza   13        20           9\n14             atmosphere         fisher   14        23          NA\n15                 nanana      peggy gou   15        15           5\n16               sprinter           dave   16        22           4\n17             back on 74         jungle   17        13          NA\n18           eat your man      dom dolla   18        59          NA\n19                therapy       budjerah   19         8          NA\n20          sorry instead    spacey jane   20        21          NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nStraight away, I can see that warm tuna did better than me, but by how much?\n\nSo, I made up a quick statistic to see how far off our predictions were. This is the sum of the magnitudes of the differences between the predicted score and the actual score. If a song didn't make the top 100, it's given the equivalent rank of 101. I then divide this by 100 to get the average deviation for each prediction.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nmy score: 36.28 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nwarm tuna's score: 26.5 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSo from these statistics, we can see that my predictions were, on average, about 10 places more off than warm tuna's.\n\n\n# Next Year?\n\nI reckon this method still has promise, but I need to sort out the name joining issue to ensure that my method is working at its maximum potential. I also want to include genre and artist country into it since it seemed to be an important factor in the final rank that I didn't account for.\n",
