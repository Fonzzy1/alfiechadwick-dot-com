<p>With Taylor Swift coming to Melbourne next week, my house has started its prep for the concert. An important part of that preparation is making friendship bracelets to trade at the concert. So we headed down to Spotlight and grabbed ourselves a couple of bags of beads to make the bracelets. However, when we opened them up, we found that the distribution of letters was all over the place. We had a heap of useless Zs while also having almost no vowels. Instead of driving back to Spotlight, I decided to see if I could make enough friendship bracelets from the letters we already had, while also being a bit clever about which songs we were going to make friendship bracelets for.</p>

<h2>First Try</h2>
<p>I set out to make an algorithm to determine the best set of song titles we could use. I want to assign each song title a cost, and then make the song with the lowest cost the bracelets. I can keep doing this until I can’t make any more bracelets. To determine the cost of a song title, I just summed the costs of its letters. The cost of the letters was the number of occurrences it had in the list of songs divided by the number of beads I had remaining for that letter.</p>

    char_counts = defaultdict(int)
    
    for string in list_of_strings:
        for char in string:
            char_counts[char] += 1
    
    return dict(char_counts)

                        flag = True
                        break
                    else:

            bead_dict[char] -= 1

<p>This was pretty good, but let’s remove the repeated songs because I don’t want to have 10 bracelets with Ivy on them. We can do this by adding <code>del cleaned_dict[cheapest_song]</code> to the end of the loop.</p>

<h2>Getting Picky</h2>
<p>I presented this list to my housemates only to get the response, ‘I hate ME!’ So, I did some cleaning to remove some of the so-called ‘banned songs’. It also turns out that I’m not allowed to listen to “London Boy” anymore since the guy it is about is canceled or something? Not sure, but now we have a new list that doesn’t include the songs we don’t want.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>bannded_songs = [
&quot;Invisible&quot;,
&quot;London Boy&quot;,
&quot;ME&quot;,
&#39;hoax&#39;,
&#39;run&#39;
]

bracelets([song for song in song_list if song not in bannded_songs], bead_dict.copy())</code></pre>

<div id="a-final-go" class="section level2">
<h2>A Final Go</h2>
<p>I tried showing this list, which received a better reception, but there were still a couple of non-negotiable songs that needed to be included. We also decided that the Qs and the Os look close enough to be interchangeable, so I changed the way we generate the cleaned dict to reflect that.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Move all the Q beads to O
bead_dict[&#39;o&#39;] += bead_dict[&#39;q&#39;]
del bead_dict[&#39;q&#39;]

required_songs = [&#39;Delicate&#39;, &#39;Lover&#39;]
    
for song in required_songs:
    print(song)
    for char in re.sub(r&#39;\W+&#39;, &#39;&#39;, song.lower()).replace(&quot;w&quot;,&quot;m&quot;).replace(&quot;q&quot;,&#39;o&#39;):
        bead_dict[char] -= 1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Delicate
## Lover</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>bracelets([song for song in song_list if song not in bannded_songs and song not in required_songs], bead_dict.copy())</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ivy
## willow
## Run
## Slut
## Glitch
## Ours
## Bad Blood
## august
## Mine
## Paris
## Midnights
## Long Live
## Last Kiss</code></pre>
<p>And there’s a final list of 14 bracelets we can make with our current beads. Would it have been faster to drive back to Spotlight to buy more beads? Probably, but this was more fun.</p>
