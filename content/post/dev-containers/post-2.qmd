title: Quick Tip for Displaying Imported Definitions in Quarto

This is a very niche issue that I run into surprisingly often. When I am
prototyping something in Python, I end up with my definitions spread across
various files that I import into a master file. However, once I go to write it
up, I end up needing to copy and paste the content into my Quarto file so I can
show the definition. I hate doing this because it means that I have something
defined twice, and the definitions might go out of sync, etc.

So when recently tidying up some files, I found a cool trick for pasting
definitions into Quarto files without have to copy and paste it. 

```python
#| echo: false
#| warnings: false
#| output: asis
from inspect import getsource as gs
from main import function_to_display
print(f'\n```python\n{gs(function_to_display)}\n```\n')
```

Just put that inside a python code chunk and it will show the definition for the
imported function.
