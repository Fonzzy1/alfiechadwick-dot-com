<p>Like many Australians, I spend my last Saturday in January getting hyped for the Triple J Hottest 100 countdown.
And for the last few years, there’s been a project run by <a href="https://100warmtunas.com/">100 Warm Tunas</a> that has been really accurate at predicting the results of the countdown.
Warm tuna makes predictions by scraping social media posts for peoples votes and then collating them as a sample of all votes, and although this is very effective, I feel misses the point a bit in trying to work out why a song is popular.</p>
<p>So I’ve set out this year to try and work out what songs will come top in the 2023 countdown, without looking at anything related to the voting itself.</p>
<div id="my-hypotheses" class="section level2">
<h2>My Hypotheses</h2>
<p>Heading into this, I have a few ideas as to factors that will make a song perform well in the countdown:</p>
<div id="plays-on-triple-j" class="section level3">
<h3>Plays on Triple J</h3>
<p>I feel this factor is pretty self explanatory, if a song is being played a lot on triple j, it’s most likely popular with the listener base and will get more votes in the Hottest 100</p>
</div>
<div id="chart-success" class="section level3">
<h3>Chart Success</h3>
<p>This one is a bit weirder, as I don’t think that just getting to number one in the aria charts will make you a top pick for triple j listeners, or else the countdown would be topped by the years biggest Pop hits. If a song is too popular in the mainstream it seems falls out of favour with triple J listeners, however there are some notable exceptions to this such as Bad Guy by Billie Eilish and Thift Shop by Macklemore who both too out the top spot in their respective years.</p>
</div>
<div id="time-of-release-and-peak" class="section level3">
<h3>Time of Release and Peak</h3>
<p>This idea is commonly thrown around when talking about the Oscars, so I feel that it’s probably going to be applicable to the hottest 100 as well. Being at peak popularity when people are voting is probably going to be usefull. Similarly, a song that hung around for a long time will probably be voted for more than a song that only hung around for a week.</p>

<div id="play-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Play Data</h1>
<p>I gathered the data for all plays on Triple J for the last 8 years from their <a href="https://music.abcradio.net.au/api/v1/plays/search.json?limit=100&amp;offset=0&amp;page=0&amp;station=triplej">API</a>, which left me a data set looking like this:</p>

<div id="number-of-plays" class="section level2">
<h2>Number of Plays</h2>
<p>To me, the most obvious indicator of a song being popular is the number of plays that it gets, so we can start by looking at that.</p>
<p><img src="/post/hottest-100/post_files/figure-html/plays-1.png" width="672" /><img src="/post/hottest-100/post_files/figure-html/plays-2.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>These plots give us a good insight into the trends in how Triple J picks songs. We have a lot of songs with almost no plays, which are mostly songs that are being presented to the audience to gauge the reaction. If they take off, the songs will be played a lot, signified by the lack of songs siting around the 40-60 plays mark. But very few get played an excessive amount, with very few making it past the 200 mark.</p>
<p>We can also see here some impact of being released early in the year, as these songs have the opportunity to be played more in a year, hence the downward slope over for each year.</p>
<p><img src="/post/hottest-100/post_files/figure-html/plays-vs-success%20-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now looking at the final ranking vs the number of plays, we can see that surprisingly, the total number of plays had very little impact on the results. As expected, most songs that got into the hottest 100 were in that pool of songs that got more than 100 plays, but weather they were rank 100 or rank 1 is impossible to tell.</p>
<p><img src="/post/hottest-100/post_files/figure-html/plays-vs-success-accounting-for-time%20-1.png" width="672" /><img src="/post/hottest-100/post_files/figure-html/plays-vs-success-accounting-for-time%20-2.png" width="672" /><img src="/post/hottest-100/post_files/figure-html/plays-vs-success-accounting-for-time%20-3.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The weekly play numbers try to remove any advantage that songs that were released earlier in the year may have had, and again, we see very little regarding a relationship between the number of plays that a song got and its performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="timing" class="section level2">
<h2>Timing</h2>
<p>Another thing I wanted to look at was when and how the songs peaked in the play data.</p>
