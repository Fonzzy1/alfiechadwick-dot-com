In my [last post](../../../2024/01/26/predicting-the-2023-hottest-100/) I ended by planting my flag and making my predictions for the Hottest 100 for 2023. And on first glance, I'm pretty happy with myself, picking not only the top song, but a good chunk of the top 20. So today I just want to do a quick follow up on how I did.

# Top 20

                         Song         Artist Predicted
    1      paint the town red       doja cat         1
    2  the worst person alive         g flip        55
    3               saving up      dom dolla        NA
    4              rhyme dust             mk        72
    5                   prada           cass        90
    6                 adore u     fred again        40
    7    what was i made for?  billie eilish         3
    8                    rush    troye sivan        10
    9             lovin on me    jack harlow        17
    10               chemical    post malone        14
    11                vampire olivia rodrigo         2
    12                 rumble       skrillex        NA
    13              kill bill            sza         9
    14             atmosphere         fisher        NA
    15                 nanana      peggy gou         5
    16               sprinter           dave         4
    17             back on 74         jungle        NA
    18           eat your man      dom dolla        NA
    19                therapy       budjerah        NA
    20          sorry instead    spacey jane        NA

The top 10 seems okay, but i did miss a lot of the top 20 completely. I seemed to be undervaluing Australian artists such as Dom Dolla, Spacey Jane, and G Flip, as well as EDM as a genre, which made up a much greater portion of the top 20 than I predicted.

So there were 55 songs in my predictions that didn't make it into the countdown, including 3 of my top 20. Funily enough though, a lot of my predictions seemed to line up with peoples opions online with [Love Type](https://www.reddit.com/r/triplej/comments/1adh146/comment/kk1b24c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [Super Ego](https://www.reddit.com/r/triplej/comments/1adh146/comment/kk16o08/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [Adored](https://www.reddit.com/r/triplej/comments/1adh146/comment/kk1hqcl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) all being mentioned as snubs from the hottest 100.

With 55 snubs, we are going to have 55 surprise songs. There doesn't seem to be a massive trend here. G flip only made it into my countdown twice, so 5 of their songs are in this list. Its also interesting seeing which conventionally popular songs are part of this list. Boy's a liar pt. 2 by Pinkpantheress and All American-Bitch which peaked at 2 and 10 on the aria charts were left out in my predictions, even though it predicted similar chart toppers in the top 10.

<img src="post-2.markdown_strict_files/figure-markdown_strict/suroprise-comps-1.png" width="768" />

Looking at these plots, it seems that the chart data for these songs didn't correctly join with the play data from triple J. After cleaning the names, I was hoping that there wouldn't be too much of a discrepancy. However, in the ARIA charts, "all-american bitch" is listed as "all-american b\*\*ch," and "boys a liar pt. 2" is listed as "boys a liar". This kind of discrepancy is probably present throughout my dataset and may have led to some major inaccuracies. However, it is also just part of life when dealing with text data.

# Did I do better than Warm Tuna?

Part of my mission when setting out to make these predictions was to outperform 100 Warm Tunas, who utilize a compilation of social media posts to formulate their predictions.

Straight away, I can see that warm tuna did better than me, but by how much?

So, I made up a quick statistic to see how far off our predictions were. This is the sum of the magnitudes of the differences between the predicted score and the actual score. If a song didn't make the top 100, it's given the equivalent rank of 101. I then divide this by 100 to get the average deviation for each prediction.

    my score: 36.28 

    warm tuna's score: 26.5 

So from these statistics, we can see that my predictions were, on average, about 10 places more off than warm tuna's.

# Next Year?

I reckon this method still has promise, but I need to sort out the name joining issue to ensure that my method is working at its maximum potential. I also want to include genre and artist country into it since it seemed to be an important factor in the final rank that I didn't account for.
