title: Fixing My Relationship with Spotify

I grew up in a weird time for music and media in general. I am old enough to  
remember going to JB Hi-Fi to buy CDs and having piles of DVDs next to the TV,  
but I am also young enough to consider myself a part of the streaming-native  
generation. I first got Spotify at age 14, and I remember watching YouTube a few  
years before that.

Looking back at what my consumption habits were like when I was  
younger, I can only think that they have changed for the worse. Instead of  
watching movies or listening to albums, I now have playlists and the endless  
recommended videos from YouTube to fill my desires for media.

I'm scared that this is only going to get worse in the future. TikTok and the UX  
changes made by Spotify to put playlists front and centre in the experience have  
turned media into something disposable. The library of things to watch or listen  
to is transient, recommended by an algorithm only interested in making you  
consume more. In short, the enshitification of media and curation has come and  
is here to stay.

And call me a Luddite, but I do have this nostalgic dream of personal curation,  
where my library of media is mine to consume as I see fit, rather than curated  
by an algorithm. The growth of records and physical media in the last few years  
shows that this is not a unique want.

And as much as I would love to be the person who has all their films on DVD and  
only listens to records, the cost, both monetarily and time-wise, makes it out  
of reach for me right now. So instead, I want to work out how to make these  
systems, most importantly Spotify, work for me in my anti-algorithmic curation  
mindset.

## The Passive vs The Active Consumer

The first step in this process is to work out what I'm not happy with on
Spotify. It's definitely not the ease of access and the value proposition of 15
dollars a month for pretty much all the music I can consume; it's great. No,
instead I think the issue is best exemplified by looking at my Spotify home
screen.

On it, we have nothing that I have selected myself. Instead, it is all curated
playlists that resemble something that I might want to listen to. And on these
playlists, as with most of the curated playlists made on Spotify, it's a
hodgepodge of songs that I definitely like, songs that resemble songs that I
like, and then some songs that I don't care for at all but Spotify thinks that I
should like. All of these are present in an order that just doesn't work.

However, because these are front and centre to my experience in Spotify, these
are what I listen to. I do get some joy out of them, but it's a very passive
experience. At no point along the way am I deciding what I should be consuming;
instead, I just take in what is given.

This behaviour is almost antithetical to my experience using iTunes and MP3
players. Here, my curation was active, with the closest thing to a
recommendation system being my most played albums section. Everything that I
heard was something that I chose because I wanted to listen to it.

The divide between active and passive curation is what makes me dislike my  
Spotify experience and nostalgise my time with my MP3 players. I think  
removing this passive curation process could go a long way to fixing my  
relationship with Spotify.

## Curation as a shared culture

Say I remove my 'passivley' created playlists. This presents me with a new
issue, how do I find new stuff?

I have been reliant on Spotify recommending me new songs for the last ten years
to flesh out my library. I'm a regular user of my Discover Weekly playlist, and
I found some of my favourite artists through their recommendations.

But I don't think that this system is particularly good for embedding me into
a shared culture, because it will only recommend things that I will probably
like based on my previous listening. That means that when a great album comes
out that doesn't fit into my 'taste', it won't be recommended. When Bad Bunny's
Debí Tirar Más Fotos came out, which is one of my favourite albums of the year
so far, it took one of my friends playing it for me to find it. And it's not
like it's a niche album; it's currently number one for the albums of the year
2025 on [Album of the Year](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/). It's just that Spotify decided that I wouldn't like
it.

I really dislike this approach to recommendations taken by Spotify. Let me
decide if I don't like something; let me try something new and out of the box
rather than playing it safe. When I want to listen to something safe, I can
choose to throw on the Wombats for the hundredth time, but at least that's my
decision.

This was something that I really liked about Letterboxd (when it had its five
minutes in the spotlight); it exposed me to films that I wouldn't have had in my
Netflix recommendations. The experience of trying something that is recommended
by another person rather than a machine contributes to a feeling of sonder, of
the shared experience that the media we consume is not unique to ourselves but
is part of a wider ecosystem, while the machine-based recommendations further
entrench this individualism that is all too prevalent in our hyper-personalised
reality.

## How to Make Spotify More Curatable

### Turn of Auto Play

This is a pretty simple one, but it does make a big difference. When I have
nothing left in the queue, by default, Spotify will continue playing with
recommendations. Turning this off will force me to at least choose what is
being listened to.

### Get Rid of Liked Songs

I think one of the main culprits of passive curation and consumption is
Spotify's implementation of the liked songs feature. Any time a song is
playing, I can click on the + button and it will be added to the 'liked songs'
playlist. This playlist becomes a dumping ground for all the songs that I
like, but if I ever throw it on shuffle, it becomes unlistenable, similar to
some of Spotify's generated playlists.

Instead, there are two things I will do. The first is liking albums instead of
songs. Artists put together albums to be a cohesive piece of work. Picking out
songs (or playing them on shuffle) is akin to reading a book and skipping half
the chapters and reading them out of order.

If I still want playlists, I will make a few instead of dumping songs into
liked songs. This makes the act of liking a song more active and will
hopefully result in more cohesive playlists.

### Get Rid of Recommendations

On my phone, this is almost impossible; however, defaulting to looking at
the library tab instead of home should present me with only things I have
decided to add to my library.

On the computer, this is best fixed with the help of Spiceify. With it, I can
download extensions that will remove recommendations from the client completely.

A couple I like are:

- [Library](https://github.com/harbassan/spicetify-apps/blob/main/library)
- [LuckyLP](https://github.com/Akasiek/spicetify-lucky-lp)
- Disable Homepage Recommendations

### Find New Places for My Recommendations

This is me trying to fix the problem of relying on personalised recommendations,
so I think that anything that is personalised or 'AI' is out of the question.
Instead, I've really enjoyed looking at reviews on [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/) or [Album of the
Year](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/). Also, [shfl](https://theshfl.com/) has been good tool for random recommendations. This
will find me stuff that other people like, but not necessarily specific to me.

Also, just asking my friends about what they are listening to has been fun, plus
Shazam has been really useful in finding the IDs of the tracks that I hear when
I am out and about.

I'm going to try implementing these over the next couple of weeks and see how my
relationship changes. I'm hoping to see myself build a better relationship with
Spotify and a stronger sense of ownership and control over my music library and
habits.
