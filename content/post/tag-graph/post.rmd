This site is build through [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), which is a marvellous little R package that integrates Hugo sites into a R workflow. A nice thing about Hugo sites are the large number of themes available to quickly integrate with your site to change the vibe. My theme is mostly just a recolored version of the [hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) theme, using [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) for the colors.

My only gripe with the theme is that it uses a default list for all types of content. If you want to look at all the posts, you get a list of posts; all the categories, a list of categories. This can definitely be improved.

# Looking at the edges

A software that I've always been meaning to use is [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which is a note taking and organising software which uses plaintext. One of its features has always really intrigued me, is the graph view which organises all of the notes based on their connections.

Thought it would be cool to implement something like this in my Hugo site.
