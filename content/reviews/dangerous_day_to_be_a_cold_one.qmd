review: >
    Another Kiwi band that will inevitably be claimed by the Australians when they
    get big, DARTZ are slowly getting their recognition across the Tasman Sea.
    Taking some classic punk rock frustration and packaging it into a fun, yet very
    aware album, the band's second album has me desperate for another show in
    Melbourne after I missed their recent one at The Tote. 'Flat Inspection' and
    'Paradise' serve as great youth anthems, capturing the frustrations of a youth
    culture that is trying to get on in a world that isn't built in its best
    interests. This is contrasted against tracks like 'Earn the Thirst', which
    provide a surprisingly introspective viewpoint for the opening track of the
    album. It does fall into the classic issue of pub rock of becoming a little
    repetitive, but you can't let that detract from a great album.
