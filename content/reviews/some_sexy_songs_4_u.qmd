  Like any Zillenial, I have fond memories of Drake. I remember "Hotline Bling"  
  and "One Dance" being the soundtracks to my high school parties. To me,  
  Drake was always associated with dancefloor bangers.  
  Unfortunately, "Some Sexy Songs 4 U" doesn't fit that mold. The first half  
  of the album was unmemorable, with the first 10 songs blending into some  
  forgettable RnB, emphasized by Drake's signature "It's hard when every  
  woman wants me" autotuned singing.  
  The only reprise was the stint of "Meet Your Padre," "Nokia," and "Die  
  Trying," all of which made for some memorable moments and the only chance  
  to turn up the music in the 75-minute album.
