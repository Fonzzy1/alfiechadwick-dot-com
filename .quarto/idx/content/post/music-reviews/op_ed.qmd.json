I am old enough to  \nremember going to JB Hi-Fi to buy CDs and having piles of DVDs next to the TV,  \nbut I am also young enough to consider myself a part of the streaming-native  \ngeneration. I first got Spotify at age 14, and I remember watching YouTube a few  \nyears before that.\n\nLooking back at what my consumption habits were like when I was  \nyounger, I can only think that they have changed for the worse. Instead of  \nwatching movies or listening to albums, I now have playlists and the endless  \nrecommended videos from YouTube to fill my desires for media.\n\nI'm scared that this is only going to get worse in the future. TikTok and the UX  \nchanges made by Spotify to put playlists front and centre in the experience have  \nturned media into something disposable. The library of things to watch or listen  \nto is transient, recommended by an algorithm only interested in making you  \nconsume more. In short, the enshitification of media and curation has come and  \nis here to stay.\n\nAnd call me a Luddite, but I do have this nostalgic dream of personal curation,  \nwhere my library of media is mine to consume as I see fit, rather than curated  \nby an algorithm. The growth of records and physical media in the last few years  \nshows that this is not a unique want.\n\nAnd as much as I would love to be the person who has all their films on DVD and  \nonly listens to records, the cost, both monetarily and time-wise, makes it out  \nof reach for me right now. So instead, I want to work out how to make these  \nsystems, most importantly Spotify, work for me in my anti-algorithmic curation  \nmindset.\n\n\nThe first step in this process is to work out what I'm not happy with on\nSpotify. It's definitely not the ease of access and the value proposition of 15\ndollars a month for pretty much all the music I can consume; it's great. No,\ninstead I think the issue is best exemplified by looking at my Spotify home\nscreen.\n\n![My Spotify Home Screen](home-phone.png)\n\nOn it, we have nothing that I have selected myself. Instead, it is all curated\nplaylists that resemble something that I might want to listen to. And on these\nplaylists, as with most of the curated playlists made on Spotify, it's a\nhodgepodge of songs that I definitely like, songs that resemble songs that I\nlike, and then some songs that I don't care for at all but Spotify thinks that I\nshould like. All of these are present in an order that just doesn't work.\n\nHowever, because these are front and centre to my experience in Spotify, these\nare what I listen to. I do get some joy out of them, but it's a very passive\nexperience. At no point along the way am I deciding what I should be consuming;\ninstead, I just take in what is given.\n\nThis behaviour is almost antithetical to my experience using iTunes and MP3\nplayers. Here, my curation was active, with the closest thing to a\nrecommendation system being my most played albums section. Everything that I\nheard was something that I chose because I wanted to listen to it.\n\nThe divide between active and passive curation is what makes me dislike my  \nSpotify experience and nostalgise my time with my MP3 players. I think  \nremoving this passive curation process could go a long way to fixing my  \nrelationship with Spotify.\n\n## Curation as a shared culture\n\nSay I remove my 'passivley' created playlists. This presents me with a new\nissue, how do I find new stuff?\n\nI have been reliant on Spotify recommending me new songs for the last ten years\nto flesh out my library. I'm a regular user of my Discover Weekly playlist, and\nI found some of my favourite artists through their recommendations.\n\nBut I don't think that this system is particularly good for embedding me into\na shared culture, because it will only recommend things that I will probably\nlike based on my previous listening. That means that when a great album comes\nout that doesn't fit into my 'taste', it won't be recommended. When Bad Bunny's\nDebí Tirar Más Fotos came out, which is one of my favourite albums of the year\nso far, it took one of my friends playing it for me to find it. And it's not\nlike it's a niche album; it's currently number one for the albums of the year\n2025 on [Album of the Year](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/). It's just that Spotify decided that I wouldn't like\nit.\n\nI really dislike this approach to recommendations taken by Spotify. Let me\ndecide if I don't like something; let me try something new and out of the box\nrather than playing it safe. When I want to listen to something safe, I can\nchoose to throw on the Wombats for the hundredth time, but at least that's my\ndecision.\n\nThis was something that I really liked about Letterboxd (when it had its five\nminutes in the spotlight); it exposed me to films that I wouldn't have had in my\nNetflix recommendations. The experience of trying something that is recommended\nby another person rather than a machine contributes to a feeling of sonder, of\nthe shared experience that the media we consume is not unique to ourselves but\nis part of a wider ecosystem, while the machine-based recommendations further\nentrench this individualism that is all too prevalent in our hyper-personalised\nreality.\n\n## How to Make Spotify More Curatable\n\n### Turn of Auto Play\n\nThis is a pretty simple one, but it does make a big difference. When I have\nnothing left in the queue, by default, Spotify will continue playing with\nrecommendations. Turning this off will force me to at least choose what is\nbeing listened to.\n\n### Get Rid of Liked Songs\n\nI think one of the main culprits of passive curation and consumption is\nSpotify's implementation of the liked songs feature. Any time a song is\nplaying, I can click on the + button and it will be added to the 'liked songs'\nplaylist. This playlist becomes a dumping ground for all the songs that I\nlike, but if I ever throw it on shuffle, it becomes unlistenable, similar to\nsome of Spotify's generated playlists.\n\nInstead, there are two things I will do. The first is liking albums instead of\nsongs. Artists put together albums to be a cohesive piece of work. Picking out\nsongs (or playing them on shuffle) is akin to reading a book and skipping half\nthe chapters and reading them out of order.\n\nIf I still want playlists, I will make a few instead of dumping songs into\nliked songs. This makes the act of liking a song more active and will\nhopefully result in more cohesive playlists.\n\n### Get Rid of Recommendations\n\nOn my phone, this is almost impossible; however, defaulting to looking at\nthe library tab instead of home should present me with only things I have\ndecided to add to my library.\n\nOn the computer, this is best fixed with the help of Spiceify. With it, I can\ndownload extensions that will remove recommendations from the client completely.\n\nA couple I like are:\n\n- [Library](https://github.com/harbassan/spicetify-apps/blob/main/library)\n- [LuckyLP](https://github.com/Akasiek/spicetify-lucky-lp)\n- Disable Homepage Recommendations\n\n![My Spotify client](client.png)\n\n### Find New Places for My Recommendations\n\nThis is me trying to fix the problem of relying on personalised recommendations,\nso I think that anything that is personalised or 'AI' is out of the question.\nInstead, I've really enjoyed looking at reviews on [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/) or [Album of the\nYear](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/). Also, [shfl](https://theshfl.com/) has been good tool for random recommendations. This\nwill find me stuff that other people like, but not necessarily specific to me.\n\nAlso, just asking my friends about what they are listening to has been fun, plus\nShazam has been really useful in finding the IDs of the tracks that I hear when\nI am out and about.\n\n---\n\nI'm going to try implementing these over the next couple of weeks and see how my\nrelationship changes. I'm hoping to see myself build a better relationship with\nSpotify and a stronger sense of ownership and control over my music library and\nhabits.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI grew up in a weird time for music and media in general.
