The ABC, like every other news\norganisation, explicitly denies scraping of their website for data in their\nterms and conditions. This blanket ban isn't completely unfounded, since AI\ncompanies have been [known to use copyrighted material in their\ntraining](https://harvardlawreview.org/blog/2024/04/nyt-v-openai-the-timess-about-face/),\nand news organisations have every right to protect their copyrighted material.\nHowever, this kind of heavy-handed blocking of scraping means that fact-checkers\naren't able to legally collect information about what is being published in the\nAustralian media landscape.\n\nBut let's say we're not so interested in the spread of misinformation by our\nnews organisations, but rather only through social media.
